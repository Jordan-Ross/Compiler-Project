1/16 (TUES)

No need to combine operator types into one class, i.e. operator tokens become <operator, '+'>; causes problems later when parsing and checking precedence

Parts of speech 
Start, terminals, nonterninals, productions

Scanner only recognizes terminals; nonterminals are things like expressions, or sets of terminals

char classes - letter, number, symbol

Outside of main switch (not just in the default case or 0-9 cases:
    if letter - parse identifier or reserved word
    if number - parse num literal
    if symbol - go into char switch

Scanner - just get the next token - don't return all at once (other than for debug)

Go back in and make sure newlines always increment the line counter - carry along with the token so it can be identified at later stages. Also check for windows line endings (\r\n). Also \r should be in the whitespace category
