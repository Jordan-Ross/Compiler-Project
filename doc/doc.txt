=== FILES ===


main.cpp    - Entry point. Handles command line args and each step of the compile process

token.h     - Stores custom data types (i.e. Token, TokenType, etc.)

scanner.h   - Scanner class definition
scanner.cpp - Implementation of scanner.h methods



=== NOTES ===



struct TokenType 
This contains every type of token the scanner can output and the parser uses.

A few notable entries:

TokenType:: - Value - Explanation
---------------------------------
EQUALS      - ==    - Comparision; "is equal to". Returns a bool
ASSIGNMENT  - :=    - Assigns the right side expression to the left variable 
RS_[...]    - [...] - The reserved word [...]. 





=== TODO ===

Handle comments properly


Is string a valid type_mark?
Seems to be referenced as a usable type in the language spec but it's not in the type_mark bnf


Is TokenType::BOOL unneeded?
It would represent boolean literals (similar to how INTEGER/FLOAT represent literal numbers)
But the only boolean literals, TRUE/FALSE, would be easier to store as reserved words.
